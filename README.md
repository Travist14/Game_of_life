A terminal visualization for Conway's Game of Life.

Run it:

```bash
python3 life.py
```

Controls:
- `q` quit
- `n` next pattern

The simulation fills the terminal window. When a pattern reaches a repeating or empty state, it automatically cycles to the next starting pattern.

I just wanted something that looked cool to fill my other monitor and thought the game of life would be nice.

A terminal visualization for Conway's Game of Life.

Run it:

```bash
python3 life.py
```

Controls:
- `q` quit
- `n` next pattern

The simulation fills the terminal window. When a pattern reaches a repeating or empty state, it automatically cycles to the next starting pattern.

you by passing `-draw` you can create the starting pattern by selecting positions with the house or navigating around using vim keys.

I just wanted something that looked cool to fill my other monitor and thought the game of life would be nice.
